Reference concerns


I've found many versions of hg38.
Some with alternates. Some without.
Fixes and patches.
By themselves, perhaps not a huge problem.
Custom references for custom problems.

However not all versions come with the additions files like a gtf/gff.
Even the hg38 "package" downloaded from https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html contains different collections of chromosomes in the fasta sequence and annotation gtf file.


Worthy of a concern?


Should I keep our references "up-to-date" by applying all of these patches and fixes?


Patch hg38 reference?
